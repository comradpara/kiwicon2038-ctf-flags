# Reception Terminal (Terminal - Reception)

The reception is well lit, and immaculately clean. There is a reception kiosk in the middle of the room to sign in. The InfraNetics welcome system takes control of your implant and announces 'Welcome to InfraNetics, where humans take the next step in evolution'. A poster beside the door reads 'Contractors must take off their shoes to prevent damage to InfraNetics property.'. To the North and South are meeting rooms, they look to be in use and the doors are locked. To the East are a set of commercial doors with a sign 'Staff Only past this point'. 

A standard welcome kiosk found at business all across the country. The kiosk is operated via an implant. Elegantly inscribed on the kiosk is a message 'Please sign in at 'xx.xx.xx.xx'.
      
The label printer looks like it's seen better days, and the paper bin is mostly full, the receptionist obviously isn't paid enough to care about emptying it.

# Merchandise Dispenser (Hallway)

The Infranetics Merchandise Machine has a numberpad to enter item codes. However it appears to be out of company swag. The Dispenser has a cable hanging out the back that has been unplugged from the ethernet |cport|n on the wall.
      
A label reads "Maintained by Elite Maintenance"... though they clearly haven't visited in some time.
      
The labels on the back of the dispenser have all been scratched out over time, but you can barely make out the IP address xx.xx.xx.xx


Find the port used by the challenge, don't cheat! :)

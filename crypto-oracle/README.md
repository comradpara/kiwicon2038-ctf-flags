# Crypto Oracle (Ethereal Ethernet Port - Temple)

The quiet open space gives you an eeire feeling as you enter. The ceiling seems impossibly high for what seems to be a single storey. There are multiple rows of benches in front of you with a floating glowing cloud that seems to shift in shape.

A giant floating ethernet port seems to pulse in and out of existance as you look at it. As you approach you hear it whispering to you "xx.xx.xx.xx"

# TV (TV - Management Lounge)

You enter the well furnished management lounge, the lighting isnt as harsh and the furniture is clearly kept up to date with the latest fashions. On your right is a advertising display, ensuring management are up to date on the latest company slogans and products.

The TV seems to be advertising directly to you as if it knows what you're thinking about and what you want. Quick stop thinking dirty thoughts!

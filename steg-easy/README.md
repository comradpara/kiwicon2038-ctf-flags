# Design Notes (Designer's Office - Nacbook)

The designers office is unique place, just like every other designers office. The walls are covered in pictures of cats in cardigans. A large copper coffee machine takes up most of the largest desk, though it has clearly seen better days. One desk has an unlocked Banana NacBook sitting open.

# Management App (Office - Post-it note)

Desks as far as the eye can see. There are so many workers tapping away at keys that it sounds like it's raining. Amid the sea of desks you spot an empty hotdesk. 

A dog-eared Post-It note is stuck to the desk. It says 'Remember to finish the new management app.'. 
      
Attached is a second Post-It note which says 'Test is currently hosted on http://xx.xx.xx.xx'.
